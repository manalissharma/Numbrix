A program that implements the game called Numbrix. The game is played on a square grid that starts with various positions filled with numbers. The objective of the game is to place numbers into the open cells so they make the path in numerical order. Only horizontal and veritcal paths are allowed. No diagonals.

III. RULES OF INPUT
-This game is played on a square grid.
-To refer to positions on the grid we use the following numbering convention-
each position is referred to by two numbers, its row and its column.
-The bottom-most left corner of the grid is position (1,1), the top-most left corner of the grid is (N,1) 
where N is the number of rows/columns in the square grid and so on.
-The input is in the form of [position-row, position-column, value]
